# Identifying gene clusters using gene co-occurrences
This repository contains all of the necessary scripts for implementing the CO-OCCUR gene cluster detection pipeline, as described in:

Gluck-Thaler E, Haridas S, Binder M, Grigoriev I, Crous PW, Spatafora JW, Bushley K, Slot JC. The architecture of metabolism maximizes biosynthetic diversity in the largest class of fungi. Submitted.

# Pipeline implementation
Scripts are sequentially numbered according to the order in which they are executed.
